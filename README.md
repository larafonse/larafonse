Hey! I am Nico, a first-generation Mexican-American, who makes stuff better. I graduated from California State of Monterey Bay (CSUMB) as a part of a 3 year accelerated bachelor's program in computer science. Currently, a Software Engineer doing Developer Experience at Gusto. In addition, I manage university students who are leading CodePath's Android course.

***I enjoy:***

- Soccer
- Reading
